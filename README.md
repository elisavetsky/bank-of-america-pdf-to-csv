# Bank of America PDF Statement to CSV

> Simple bank statement parser and CSV conversion

Bank of America PDF Statement to CSV is a local-only Progressive Web App (PWA) built to perform simple parsing of a PDF statement using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which is then exported as a CSV. **Files are converted offline and never leave your browser for the sake of privacy.**

PDF.js is used to convert PDFs into images, then Tesseract.js is used to extract text from them. Finally, the text is stripped of irrelevant data and formatted as a CSV for importing into your favorite finance tracker.
